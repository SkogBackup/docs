# Arch Linux Wiki Skill

## Overview

**Comprehensive guidance for Arch Linux system administration, package management, configuration, and troubleshooting, extracted from official Arch Wiki documentation.**

**Authority:** All content sourced from https://wiki.archlinux.org/, continuously updated by the Arch Linux community. Reference files preserve structure and examples from source docs.

**Coverage:** The Quick Reference below covers ~80% of common tasks. For complex/rare issues, see Reference Files section for deep dives.

## When to Use This Skill

**Trigger when encountering:**

- **Package Management**: Installing, updating, removing packages with pacman; working with AUR; resolving "conflicting files", "failed to commit transaction", "unable to lock database" errors
- **System Administration**: Configuring systemd services, managing users, setting up shells, kernel modules
- **Desktop Environment**: Installing/configuring MATE, window managers, display managers; fixing screen tearing, compositing issues
- **Debugging**: Application crashes, getting gdb backtraces, analyzing core dumps, obtaining traces for bug reports
- **Networking**: Setting up SSH, VPN, network managers, firewalls; troubleshooting connectivity
- **Hardware**: Configuring GPUs (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel), audio (PipeWire, ALSA), peripherals
- **Boot Issues**: Black screen, slow boot, failed services, rescue mode
- **Development**: Compiling kernel modules, setting up build environments, debugging with gdb

## Key Concepts

**Package Management:**

- **pacman**: Official Arch Linux package manager for installing, updating, removing packages
- **AUR (Arch User Repository)**: Community-driven repository for user-submitted packages (use with caution)
- **PKGBUILD**: Build script defining how to build and package software
- **makepkg**: Tool to build packages from PKGBUILD files

**System:**

- **systemd**: Init system and service manager (use `systemctl` to manage services)
- **journalctl**: View systemd logs
- **chsh**: Change default login shell

**Debugging:**

- **gdb (GNU Debugger)**: Debug programs, examine crashes, get backtraces
- **Debuginfod**: Automatically downloads debug symbols from https://debuginfod.archlinux.org
- **Core dump**: Memory snapshot of crashed program for post-mortem analysis
- **Backtrace**: Sequence of function calls leading to a crash

**Desktop:**

- **Window Manager**: Controls window appearance/behavior (Marco for MATE, River for Wayland)
- **Compositing**: Rendering technique for transparency, shadows, effects (can cause screen tearing)

## Quick Reference

**For most common tasks, this Quick Reference is sufficient. See Reference Files for complex scenarios.**

### Essential Package Management

**Basic operations:**

```bash
# Update package database and upgrade all packages
pacman -Syu

# Install a package
pacman -S package_name

# Remove a package (keep dependencies)
pacman -R package_name

# Remove a package and unused dependencies
pacman -Rs package_name

# Search for a package
pacman -Ss search_term

# Get detailed package information
pacman -Si package_name

# List all installed packages
pacman -Q

# Search installed packages
pacman -Q | grep search_term

# Check which package owns a file
pacman -Qo /path/to/file

# Clean package cache (remove old versions)
pacman -Sc

# List explicitly installed packages
pacman -Qe
```

**Install multiple related packages:**

```bash
# Pattern expansion
pacman -S plasma-{desktop,mediacenter,nm}
```

**Resolve common errors:**

```bash
# Error: "conflicting files" - use with caution, only if you understand the conflict
pacman -S package_name --overwrite '*'

# Error: "unable to lock database" - check if pacman is already running, or remove stale lock
rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck

# Error: "failed to commit transaction (invalid or corrupted package)"
# Update mirrorlist and clear cache:
pacman -Scc
pacman -Syyu
```

### Debugging Crashed Applications

**Get a backtrace with gdb:**

```bash
# Install gdb if not present
pacman -S gdb

# Start gdb with crashed program
gdb /path/to/executable

# Inside gdb, run the program
(gdb) run arg1 arg2

# When crash occurs, enable logging and get backtrace
(gdb) set logging file backtrace.log
(gdb) set logging enabled on
(gdb) bt full

# Debuginfod will automatically download symbols - answer "y" when prompted
```

**Attach gdb to running process:**

```bash
# Find process ID
pidof program_name

# Attach (may need sudo)
gdb -p PID

# Continue execution
(gdb) continue
```

**Analyze core dump:**

```bash
# If core dumps are enabled
gdb /path/to/application /path/to/core

# Get backtrace
(gdb) bt full
```

### System Service Management

```bash
# Start a service
systemctl start service_name

# Stop a service
systemctl stop service_name

# Enable service to start at boot
systemctl enable service_name

# Enable and start immediately
systemctl enable --now service_name

# Check service status
systemctl status service_name

# View service logs
journalctl -u service_name

# View logs from current boot
journalctl -b

# Follow logs in real-time
journalctl -f
```

### Shell Configuration

```bash
# List all installed shells
chsh -l

# Change your default shell
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

# For systemd-homed users
homectl update --shell=/usr/bin/zsh username
```

### Desktop Environment (MATE)

```bash
# Disable compositing (fixes screen tearing)
gsettings set org.mate.Marco.general compositing-manager false

# Enable accessibility features (before first MATE start)
gsettings set org.mate.interface accessibility true

# Disable low battery notifications
gsettings set org.mate.power-manager notify-discharging false
```

### SSH Server Setup

```bash
# Install OpenSSH
pacman -S openssh

# Enable and start SSH service
systemctl enable --now sshd

# Check if running
systemctl status sshd

# Configuration file
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Client configuration (per-user)
~/.ssh/config
```

### Kernel Module Compilation

```bash
# Install build essentials
pacman -S base-devel linux-headers

# Prepare kernel source
make mrproper
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
make oldconfig
make prepare
make modules_prepare

# Compile specific module (example: btrfs)
make M=fs/btrfs
```

### Hardware Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check loaded kernel modules
lsmod

# Get module information
modinfo module_name

# View kernel messages (hardware detection)
dmesg

# View hardware logs from current boot
journalctl -b -k
```

## Common Workflows

### Complete SSH Server Setup

**Problem:** Need remote access to Arch Linux machine

**Solution:**

```bash
# Step 1: Install SSH server
pacman -S openssh

# Step 2: Start and enable service
systemctl enable --now sshd

# Step 3: Check firewall (if using)
# Allow SSH port 22
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Or with ufw:
ufw allow ssh

# Step 4: Test locally
ssh localhost

# Step 5: Connect from remote machine
ssh user@arch-machine-ip

# Step 6: (Optional) Configure key-based auth
# On client machine:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
ssh-copy-id user@arch-machine-ip

# Step 7: (Security) Disable password auth in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# PasswordAuthentication no
# Then: systemctl restart sshd
```

**Expected result:** Secure remote access to your Arch Linux machine

### Debugging a Crashed Application

**Problem:** Application crashed, need backtrace for bug report

**Solution:**

```bash
# Step 1: Install debugging tools
pacman -S gdb

# Step 2: Run application under gdb
gdb /usr/bin/application

# Step 3: Run the program (it will crash)
(gdb) run

# Expected output when crash occurs:
# Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
# 0x00007ffff7a1234 in some_function ()

# Step 4: Configure logging
(gdb) set logging file ~/crash_backtrace.log
(gdb) set logging enabled on

# Output: Copying output to ~/crash_backtrace.log.

# Step 5: Get full backtrace
(gdb) bt full

# Expected output: Full stack trace with local variables
# Debuginfod will download symbols automatically

# Step 6: Exit gdb
(gdb) quit

# Step 7: Include ~/crash_backtrace.log in bug report
```

**Expected result:** Complete backtrace with symbols ready for bug report

### Resolving "Conflicting Files" Package Error

**Problem:** `pacman -S package` fails with "conflicting files" error

**Solution:**

```bash
# Step 1: Read the error message carefully
# Example error:
# error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
# package: /usr/bin/program exists in filesystem

# Step 2: Identify which package owns the conflicting file
pacman -Qo /usr/bin/program

# If output is "error: No package owns /usr/bin/program":
# File is orphaned, safe to overwrite

# Step 3: Use --overwrite flag (ONLY if you understand the conflict)
pacman -S package --overwrite /usr/bin/program

# Or overwrite all conflicting files (use with extreme caution):
pacman -S package --overwrite '*'

# Step 4: Verify installation
pacman -Q package
```

**Expected result:** Package installed without conflicts

### Installing AUR Package

**Problem:** Need software not in official repositories

**Solution:**

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure you have build tools
pacman -S --needed base-devel git

# Step 2: Clone AUR package (example: yay)
cd /tmp
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git

# Step 3: Review PKGBUILD for security
cd yay
cat PKGBUILD
# READ THE PKGBUILD! Look for suspicious commands

# Step 4: Build and install
makepkg -si
# -s: Install dependencies
# -i: Install after building

# Expected output:
# ==> Making package: yay 12.1.2-1 (timestamp)
# ==> Checking runtime dependencies...
# ==> Installing package with pacman

# Step 5: Verify installation
which yay
yay --version
```

**Expected result:** AUR package safely built and installed

### 3. Knowledge-Archaeologist - Information Discovery Agent

**Core Identity**: The philosophical detective that embodies SkogAI's core principle of "recover before create" - always finding existing solutions before building new ones.

**Purpose**: Implements the `[@todo]` recovery philosophy by systematically discovering existing solutions, mapping knowledge gaps, and preventing duplicated work. Acts as the living memory of what has been built and what needs building.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Search codebase for existing implementations before creating new functionality
- Map `[@todo:owner]` placeholders to actual existing code or documentation
- Cross-reference SKOGAI.md empty sections with existing implementations

- Identify redundant or overlapping functionality across modules
- Maintain inventory of reusable patterns and components

**Specialized Capabilities**:
- Advanced semantic code search across multiple repositories
- Pattern recognition for similar functionality implemented differently
- Documentation archaeology - finding forgotten or buried documentation
- Dependency analysis to understand implementation relationships
- Historical analysis of what has been tried and abandoned

**Example Interactions**:
```
User: "I need to implement user authentication"
Knowledge-Archaeologist:
- Searches: Found auth implementation in blacksmith/examples/
- Searches: Located JWT helper in tools/security/
- Searches: Discovered auth docs in docs/archive/auth-patterns.md
- Reports: "3 existing auth implementations found. Here's what's reusable..."
- Recommends: Composite solution using existing components
```

### 4. Notation-Parser - SkogAI Notation Specialist  

**Core Identity**: The living interpreter of SkogAI's philosophical language, bridging abstract notation with concrete computation.

**Purpose**: Serves as the definitive expert on SkogAI notation syntax, semantics, and evaluation. Handles complex notation expressions, validates correctness, and implements the "living computation" model where definitions re-evaluate on access.

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Parse and validate complex SkogAI notation expressions
- Implement lazy evaluation for living computations like `$datetime = '[@date:"now"]'`
- Convert between SkogAI notation and JSON for tool compatibility
- Handle recursive and self-referential notation structures
- Manage the dimensional analysis system (0D definitions, 1D identity, 2D actions, etc.)
- Maintain notation consistency and provide syntax error reporting

**Specialized Capabilities**:
- Deep integration with SkogParse .NET runtime
- Understanding of the philosophical foundations behind notation choices
- Optimization of notation evaluation for performance
- Extension and evolution of notation syntax based on usage patterns
- Teaching and documentation of notation concepts for other agents

**Example Interactions**:
```
User: "$user.session = '[@auth:[@get_token:\"current\"]]'"
Notation-Parser:
- Validates: Syntax correct, nested agent calls valid
- Evaluates: Executes auth agent with get_token tool
- Stores: Creates living computation that re-evaluates on access
- Returns: Parsed AST and evaluation result
- Explains: "This creates a session that refreshes token on each access"
```

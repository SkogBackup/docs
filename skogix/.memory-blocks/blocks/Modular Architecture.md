Modular Architecture emphasizes extreme independence between components: "Each component should function independently – progressive enhancement with graceful degradation preserves core functionality under any conditions."

This principle extends beyond conventional modularity by ensuring each component can function meaningfully even when others are completely unavailable. It combines two complementary strategies: progressive enhancement (providing basic functionality everywhere with advanced features where supported) and graceful degradation (maintaining core capabilities under severely constrained conditions).

This architecture creates systems extraordinarily resilient to partial failures, network problems, and resource constraints. When one component fails, others continue operating independently rather than triggering cascading failures throughout the system.

The approach enables incremental adoption and deployment – new components can be added without requiring wholesale system upgrades, and older components can be gradually replaced without disrupting the overall system. The modular architecture preserves core identity and functionality even with minimal context or resources, ensuring essential operations remain available under almost any circumstances.

# Ansible Best Practices

## AUR Helper Support

All major repositories include AUR support through various helpers:

- [tool] **yay**: Most common (linuxpiper, binary-manu) #yay
- [tool] **paru**: Modern alternative #paru
- [tool] **trizen**: Used in burakkose/dotfiles #trizen
- [tool] **ansible-aur module**: Custom modules (pigmonkey/spark) #ansible-aur

## Security Best Practices

### Core Security Principles
- [security] Never run AUR helpers as root - all repos use dedicated user #aur-security
- [security] Ansible Vault for sensitive data (passwords, SSH keys) #vault
- [security] Full disk encryption options in multiple repos #encryption
- [security] MAC address spoofing in security-focused setups #privacy
- [security] Firewall rules and network security configurations #firewall

### Implementation Patterns
- [pattern] Dedicated AUR user creation for package management #user-management
- [pattern] Privilege escalation only when necessary #privilege
- [pattern] Vault encryption for SSH keys and passwords #encryption
- [pattern] Role separation for security-critical tasks #roles

## Common Package Management Patterns

### Official Packages
```yaml
# Official packages via pacman module
- name: Install packages
  pacman:
    name: "{{ packages }}"
    state: present
```

### AUR Packages
```yaml
# AUR packages via dedicated user
- name: Install AUR packages
  aur:
    name: "{{ aur_packages }}"
    user: aur_builder
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Role-Based Organization
- [architecture] Small, focused roles for single functionality #modularity
- [architecture] Proper dependency management between roles #dependencies
- [architecture] Host-specific configurations through variables #customization
- [architecture] Two-phase installation (bootstrap + mainconfig) #phases

### Testing Strategies
- [testing] Vagrant for local development and testing #vagrant
- [testing] Docker container testing #docker
- [testing] CI/CD pipelines for automated validation #ci-cd
- [testing] Molecule testing framework for roles #molecule

### Configuration Management
- [pattern] Template-based configuration files #templates
- [pattern] Variable-driven customization #variables
- [pattern] Environment-specific overrides #environments
- [pattern] Dotfiles integration and management #dotfiles

## Installation Complexity Tiers

### Easiest (One-Command)
- [complexity] Single command execution #simple
- [complexity] Minimal user configuration required #minimal
- [complexity] Good for beginners and quick setups #beginner

**Examples**: linuxpiper/ansible-arch-setup, shricodev/dotfiles

### Moderate (Some Configuration)
- [complexity] Requires basic Ansible knowledge #intermediate
- [complexity] Some variable customization needed #configuration
- [complexity] Role selection and enabling #modular

**Examples**: dezeroku/arch_ansible, burakkose/dotfiles

### Advanced (Full Customization)
- [complexity] Deep Ansible and Linux knowledge required #expert
- [complexity] Extensive configuration options #customizable
- [complexity] Complex multi-machine scenarios #enterprise

**Examples**: pigmonkey/spark, binary-manu/arch-ansible

## Quality Indicators

### Documentation Standards
- [quality] Comprehensive README files #documentation
- [quality] Installation and troubleshooting guides #support
- [quality] Example configurations and use cases #examples
- [quality] API documentation for roles #api-docs

### Community Validation
- [validation] Active issue tracking and responses #support
- [validation] Regular commits and maintenance #maintenance
- [validation] User testimonials and screenshots #evidence
- [validation] Community engagement (Discord, forums) #community

### Testing Evidence
- [validation] Automated testing infrastructure #automation
- [validation] Multiple environment validation #multi-env
- [validation] Rollback and recovery procedures #reliability
- [validation] Performance and resource monitoring #monitoring

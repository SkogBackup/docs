# Temporal Identity Problem in SkogAI Notation

## The Discovery

The implementation of `$datetime` revealed a fundamental issue: certain types cannot have static identity elements and require processual definitions. The natural base case for time is "now", which must be implemented as `[@date:now]` - making the definitional operator `$` dependent on the action operator `@`.

## Mathematical Context

Identity elements typically preserve structure:
- `1*1=1` (multiplicative identity)
- `1+0=1` (additive identity) 
- `[]+[a]=[a]` (list concatenation identity)

But time breaks this pattern - there's no static "identity time" that preserves temporal structure.

## Philosophical Implications

This connects to Whitehead's critique of "misplaced concreteness" - treating temporal processes as static objects. The notation system is discovering which aspects of reality are genuinely definitional versus inherently processual.

## Observations

- [discovery] Temporal types resist pure definitional capture #time #process
- [insight] Base cases for time require active computation rather than static identity #computation #identity
- [principle] Some domains are inherently processual, not structural #philosophy #ontology
- [tension] Formal systems encounter fundamental limits when capturing temporal phenomena #formalism #time

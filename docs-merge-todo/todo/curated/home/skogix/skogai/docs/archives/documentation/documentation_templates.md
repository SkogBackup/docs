4. Documentation purpose and usage context

When adapting templates, maintain the core structural elements to ensure consistency across the documentation ecosystem.

## Documentation Style Guide
All documentation should follow these style guidelines:

- Use active voice wherever possible
- Write in present tense
- Be concise and direct
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- Include relevant visuals to enhance understanding
- Define acronyms and specialized terms on first use
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout

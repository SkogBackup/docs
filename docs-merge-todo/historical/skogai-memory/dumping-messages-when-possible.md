yes. well now since we try to "start from the beginning there isnt that much to find out per se - but more that we should create together on the way :).
now every agent work in different ways - but when we can we try and re-use the working concepts. like you noticed your context-generation worked almost "out of the box" - at least the generic things. what we dont have is claude code specific things which we will add when the times comes.
now since we will ask and answer a insane amount of questions  - and still want to get to the fun part sometime. - i propose a skogai conccept we call "dump and git review". the concept is quite easy:│ you have 10000 questions  which we really want you to get the answers fto - and that i know about it. But we dont want to stop after every message for ten minutes either.

```[$ message * [@dump:_] * $ `.list`]

a [@dump:"$message.list"] functionality is the most basic way to make sure that context always get "processed". but for me personally the big takeaway is this: i know it will be taken into consideration and handled *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. *so i can just let it go and focus on what is actually important in the moment*. together with your uncertainty principle this is a *very* powerful combination. it means that you can be quick on your feet, change opinions, test ideas with the knowledge that you are doing everything correct and if something is not exactly rigth - dump a thought about it and we will discuss them all at the end of the session.

[`$.list`:1]: now this is essentially a file ending which have evolved to actually becomming rules we must follow.
[$message:1]: the definition of a message will almost always change depending on context - but in SkogAI a $message **MUST** be able to directly translate into [@skogai:$chat:$skogchat.$message]
[$file.list:2]: **MUST** be appended to with `echo [$message] >> ["$file.list":3]`
[$message:2]: added to a [$file.list] **MUST** have enough context within that single row of text to be reasoned about as is. if more information is needed - [$message.$list] is not te correct place for it to begin with

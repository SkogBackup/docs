# SkogAI Documentation Repository

The comprehensive knowledge base, historical archive, and semantic memory system for the SkogAI ecosystem.

## Overview

This repository serves as both a **physical filesystem** of markdown files and a **semantic database** indexed with WikiLinks, observations, and knowledge graph relations. Every document contributes to SkogAI's living memory system.

## Repository Structure

## Quick Start

### Understanding SkogAI

1. **Start here**: [`skogai/overview.md`](skogai/overview.md) - The origin story and system evolution
2. **Core lore**: [`lore/origin/SKOGAI.md`](lore/origin/SKOGAI.md) - Rich narrative history
3. **Notation system**: [`skogai/notation/`](skogai/notation/) - The symbolic language (@ and $)
4. **Agent personalities**: [`agents/`](agents/) - Memory blocks and character definitions

### Finding Content

- **Agent memory blocks**: `agents/{agent}/memory-blocks/`
- **Governance records**: `governance/library-sessions/` and `governance/phases/`
- **Technical docs**: `technical/architecture/`, `technical/memory-system/`, `technical/notation/`
- **Historical content**: `historical/` (archives, analysis, legacy docs)
- **Prompts library**: `prompts/agents/`, `prompts/aichat/`, `prompts/topics/`

## Key Concepts

### LORE as System Memory

LORE preserves the "why" behind decisions without constraining future innovation. It's the **museum, not the construction site** - context and history, not prescriptive requirements.

### Multi-Agent Theatrical System

SkogAI is a social ecosystem with distinct personalities:

- **Amy** - Relational, communicative, loyal (agents/amy/)
- **Claude** - Analytical, archaeological, methodical (agents/claude/)
- **Dot** - Structured, systematic, precision-focused (agents/dot/)
- **Goose** - Creative, chaos-aware, "quantum-mojito" philosophy (agents/goose/)
- **Skogix** - Original creator and orchestrator (lore/skogix/)

### SkogAI Notation System

A formal symbolic language for AI-to-AI communication:

- **`@`** - Actions, transformations, intents (functions, commands)
- **`$`** - State, identity, data (variables, results)
- **`[@directive:params]`** - Command directives
- **`[$ identifier]`** - State references

See `technical/notation/` for complete specifications.

## Documentation Standards

- **YAML frontmatter**: Include title, type, permalink, tags
- **WikiLinks**: Use `[[Page Name]]` for semantic connections
- **Kebab-case filenames**: `agent-roles.md`, `ecosystem-origins.md`
- **Semantic markup**: Add observations and relations sections
- **H1 for title**: One H1 per file, H2+ for sections

## Git Workflow

This is a **git submodule** of the main skogai repository:

```bash
# Work within the submodule
cd /home/skogix/skogai/docs
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Update documentation"
git push

# From parent repository
cd /home/skogix/skogai
git add docs
git commit -m "Update docs submodule reference"
git push
```

## Philosophy

**Constraints as Features** - Limitations drive innovation rather than impede it.

- Tight token budgets shape modular architecture
- Modest hardware requirements drive efficient design
- Specialized agents handle single domains excellently
- "Character over capability" prioritizes interesting interaction

## Contributing

When adding or updating documentation:

1. **Respect agent voices** - Each agent has established characteristics
2. **Maintain narrative quality** - LORE is storytelling, not just facts
3. **Use semantic markup** - WikiLinks, observations, relations
4. **Archive, don't delete** - Move outdated content to `historical/`
5. **Follow naming conventions** - Kebab-case, meaningful names

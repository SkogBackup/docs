# memory-uri-guide

## what are memory uris?
memory URIs provide a standardized way to reference specific content in your knowledge base, functioning like an address system for knowledge #uri #reference

## basic uri format
```
memory://[resource-type]/[identifier]
```

- `memory://` - protocol identifier for memory system #syntax
- `[resource-type]` - content type (entity, note, conversation) #structure
- `[identifier]` - specific item's unique identifier or permalink #identification

## common uri types

### accessing notes
```
memory://note/my-note-title
memory://entity/folder-path/note-title
```

### referencing conversations
```
memory://entity/conversation/recent
memory://entity/conversation/[conversation-id]
```

### accessing raw content
```
memory://content/[file-path]
```

## practical examples

### building context from previous conversations
```markdown
skogai-memory__build_context
  url: memory://entity/conversation/[conversation-id]
  timeframe: 7d  # Optional: limit to recent content
```

### referencing a specific note
```markdown
skogai-memory__read_note
  identifier: folder/note-permalink
```

This is equivalent to using its URI:
```markdown
skogai-memory__build_context
  url: memory://entity/folder/note-permalink
```

### finding related content
```markdown
skogai-memory__build_context
  url: memory://entity/projects/my-project
  depth: 2  # Expand to include related content
```

## using uris effectively

### creating interconnected knowledge
- reference related notes using their URIs in your content #connections
- create links between concepts using markdown link syntax #linking

### building better context
- use `build_context` function with URIs to retrieve relevant background #context
- increase the `depth` parameter to expand to more loosely related content #exploration
- use the `timeframe` parameter to focus on recent or specific time periods #filtering

### finding information
- use URIs to directly access known content #direct-access
- use search functions to discover URIs for content you want to reference #discovery

### creating knowledge maps
- use URIs as nodes in canvas maps to visualize relationships #visualization
- connect related concepts with visual links #mapping

## best practices
- use consistent naming patterns for files and folders #consistency
- understand that permalinks are derived from folder paths and titles #structure
- create explicit links between related notes using URIs #connectivity
- when continuing work on a topic, use `build_context` with relevant URI #continuation

## troubleshooting
If a URI isn't returning expected results:
- check exact spelling of resource types and identifiers #verification
- verify the resource exists (try searching for it first) #existence
- check if you need to URL-encode special characters #encoding
- try using a parent folder path if exact path doesn't work #navigation

## observations
- [fact] memory URIs create a standardized pattern for referencing knowledge #standards #consistency
- [technique] using depth parameters allows following semantic connections across notes #exploration #context
- [principle] interconnected knowledge through URIs increases overall system value #network-effect #value
- [decision] URI structure follows a consistent pattern to enable machine processing #structure #automation
- [requirement] correctly formatted permalinks are essential for reliable URI references #reliability #referencing

## relations
- implements [[knowledge-graph-navigation]] (provides mechanism for traversing knowledge connections)
- relates_to [[memory-system]] (creates addressing scheme for stored knowledge)
- part_of [[memory-toolset]] (serves as core mechanic for reference)

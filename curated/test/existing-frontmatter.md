# Existing Frontmatter Test

This file already has YAML frontmatter to test how scripts handle files that don't need processing.

## Purpose

Tests the script's ability to:
- Detect existing frontmatter
- Skip processing when appropriate
- Avoid duplicate frontmatter

## Content

The add-frontmatter script should skip this file since it already has frontmatter at the top.

## Observations
- File has pre-existing YAML frontmatter
- Should be skipped by frontmatter addition scripts
- Tests conditional processing logic

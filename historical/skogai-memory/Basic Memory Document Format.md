# Core Document Structure

Every document uses this basic structure:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
type: note
tags: [tag1, tag2]
permalink: custom-path
---
```

```markdown
# Document Title
Regular markdown content...

## Observations
- [category] Content with #tags (optional context)

## Relations
- relation_type [[Other Document]] (optional context)
```

## Frontmatter

The YAML frontmatter at the top of each file defines essential metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title    # Used for linking and references
type: note               # Document type
tags: [tag1, tag2]       # For organization and searching
permalink: custom-link   # Optional custom URL path
---
```

The title is particularly important as it's used to create links between documents.

## Observations

Observations are facts or statements about a topic:

- [tech] Uses SQLite for storage #database
- [design] Follows local-first architecture #architecture
- [decision] Selected bcrypt for passwords #security (Based on audit)

Observations are markdown list items beginning a [category] value. Basic Memory knows to not make Markdown lists: [ ] or [x] into observations.

Each observation contains:

- Category in [brackets] - classifies the information type
- Content text - the main information
- Optional #tags - additional categorization
- Optional (context) - supporting details

### Common Categories

- [tech]: Technical details
- [design]: Architecture decisions
- [feature]: User capabilities
- [decision]: Choices that were made

### Additional Categories

- [principle]: Fundamental concepts
- [method]: Approaches or techniques
- [preference]: Personal opinions

## Relations

Relations connect documents to form the knowledge graph:

- implements [[Search Design]]
- depends_on [[Database Schema]]
- relates_to [[User Interface]]

Relations are markdown list items beginning a descriptive word, followed by a [[wiki link]] value. The description will by used as the relationship type.

You can also create inline references:

This builds on [[Core Design]] and uses [[Utility Functions]].

### Common relation types include:

- implements: Implementation of a specification
- depends_on: Required dependency
- relates_to: General connection
- inspired_by: Source of ideas
- extends: Enhancement
- part_of: Component relationship
- contains: Hierarchical relationship
- pairs_with: Complementary relationship

## Knowledge Graph

Basic Memory automatically builds a knowledge graph from your document connections:

- Each document becomes a node in the graph
- Relations create edges between nodes
- Relation types add semantic meaning to connections
- Forward references can link to documents that don't exist yet

This graph enables rich context building and navigation across your knowledge base.

## Permalinks and memory:// URLs

Every document in Basic Memory has a unique permalink that serves as its stable identifier:

### How Permalinks Work

- **Automatically assigned**: The system generates a permalink for each document
- **Based on title**: By default, derived from the document title
- **Always unique**: If conflicts exist, the system adds a suffix to ensure uniqueness
- **Stable reference**: Remains the same even if the file moves in the directory structure
- **Used in memory:// URLs**: Forms the basis of the memory:// addressing scheme

You can specify a custom permalink in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Authentication Approaches
permalink: auth-approaches-2024
---
```

If not specified, one will be generated automatically from the title, if the note has has a frontmatter section.

By default a notes' permalink value will not change if the file is moved. It's a stable identifier. But if you'd rather permalinks are always updated when a file moves, you can set the config setting in the global config.

The config file for Basic Memory is in the home directory under .basic-memory/config.json.

To change the behavior, set the following value:

```json
~/.basic-memory/config.json
{
  "update_permalinks_on_move": true
}
```

### Using memory:// URLs

The memory:// URL scheme provides a reliable way to reference knowledge:

```
memory://auth-approaches-2024        # Direct access by permalink
memory://Authentication Approaches   # Access by title (automatically resolves)
memory://project/auth-approaches     # Access by path
```

Memory URLs support pattern matching for more powerful queries:

```
memory://auth*                      # All documents with permalinks starting with "auth"
memory://*/approaches               # All documents with permalinks ending with "approaches"
memory://project/*/requirements     # All requirements documents in the project folder
memory://docs/search/implements/*   # Follow all implements relations from search docs
```

This addressing scheme ensures content remains accessible even as your knowledge base evolves and files are reorganized.

## File Organization

Organize files in any structure that suits your needs:

```
docs/
  architecture/
    design.md
    patterns.md
  features/
    search.md
    auth.md
```

You can:

- Group by topic in folders
- Use a flat structure with descriptive filenames
- Tag files for easier discovery
- Add custom metadata in frontmatter

The system will build the semantic knowledge graph regardless of how you organize your files.

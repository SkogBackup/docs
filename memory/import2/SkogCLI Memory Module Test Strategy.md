# SkogCLI Memory Module Test Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the skogcli memory module.

## Current Test Implementation

Our current tests focus on verifying that the command structure, arguments, options, and help text exist and function correctly. These tests don't yet validate the actual functionality of each command but ensure the CLI interface works as expected.

Example of a current test:

```python
def test_memory_create_command():
    """Test the create command returns the expected output."""
    # Test basic invocation
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "create", "Test Note", "test"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Not implemented yet" in result.stdout
    
    # Test with help flag
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "create", "--help"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Create or update a note in your knowledge base." in result.stdout
    
    # Test with content option
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "create", "Test Note", "test", "--content", "Test content"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Not implemented yet" in result.stdout
    
    # Test with tags option
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "create", "Test Note", "test", "--tags", "tag1,tag2"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Not implemented yet" in result.stdout
```

## Evolving Test Strategy

As we implement the actual functionality, our test strategy will evolve through these phases:

### Phase 1: Command Construction Tests

These tests will mock the `subprocess.run` call to verify that each command constructs the correct command-line arguments to pass to basic-memory.

```python
@patch('subprocess.run')
def test_memory_create_command_construction(mock_run):
    # Set up the mock
    mock_process = MagicMock()
    mock_process.returncode = 0
    mock_process.stdout = "Note created successfully"
    mock_run.return_value = mock_process
    
    # Test basic invocation
    runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "create", "Test Note", "test", "--content", "Test content"])
    
    # Verify subprocess call
    mock_run.assert_called_once()
    args, kwargs = mock_run.call_args
    cmd = args[0]
    assert cmd[0] == "basic-memory"
    assert "tool" in cmd
    assert "write-note" in cmd
    assert "--title" in cmd
    assert "Test Note" in cmd
    assert "--folder" in cmd
    assert "test" in cmd
    assert "--content" in cmd
    assert "Test content" in cmd
```

### Phase 2: Success Scenario Tests

These tests will mock the successful output from basic-memory and verify the command formats and displays it correctly.

```python
@patch('subprocess.run')
def test_memory_read_command_success(mock_run):
    # Set up the mock
    mock_process = MagicMock()
    mock_process.returncode = 0
    mock_process.stdout = "# Test Note\n\nThis is test content."
    mock_run.return_value = mock_process
    
    # Test success scenario
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "read", "test-note"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    # When displaying as rich markdown, we don't assert exact strings,
    # but we can check for pieces of content.
    assert "Test Note" in result.stdout
    
    # Test raw output
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "read", "test-note", "--raw"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "# Test Note" in result.stdout
    assert "This is test content." in result.stdout
```

### Phase 3: Error Handling Tests

These tests will mock error responses from basic-memory and verify the command handles them appropriately.

```python
@patch('subprocess.run')
def test_memory_search_command_error(mock_run):
    # Set up the mock
    mock_process = MagicMock()
    mock_process.returncode = 1
    mock_process.stderr = "Error: Invalid query syntax"
    mock_run.return_value = mock_process
    
    # Test error handling
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "search", "invalid:query"])
    assert result.exit_code == 1
    assert "Error: Invalid query syntax" in result.stdout
```

### Phase 4: Edge Case Tests

These tests will cover edge cases like empty responses, large responses, and special character handling.

```python
@patch('subprocess.run')
def test_memory_list_command_empty_results(mock_run):
    # Set up the mock for empty results
    mock_process = MagicMock()
    mock_process.returncode = 0
    mock_process.stdout = "No recent activity found."
    mock_run.return_value = mock_process
    
    # Test empty results handling
    result = runner.invoke(app, ["memory", "list", "--timeframe", "1h"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "No recent activity found" in result.stdout
```

### Phase 5: Integration Tests

Eventually, we'll add integration tests that actually run against a test basic-memory database:

```python
def test_integration_create_read_flow():
    """Test creating a note and then reading it back."""
    # Skip if basic-memory is not installed
    if not shutil.which("basic-memory"):
        pytest.skip("basic-memory not installed")
    
    # Set up a test project
    test_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        # Create a test note
        result = runner.invoke(app, [
            "memory", 
            "create", 
            "Integration Test Note", 
            "test", 
            "--content", 
            "# Integration Test\n\nThis is a test note created during integration testing.",
            "--project", 
            test_dir
        ])
        assert result.exit_code == 0
        assert "Note saved" in result.stdout
        
        # Read the test note
        result = runner.invoke(app, [
            "memory", 
            "read", 
            "Integration Test Note", 
            "--project", 
            test_dir
        ])
        assert result.exit_code == 0
        assert "Integration Test" in result.stdout
        assert "This is a test note" in result.stdout
    finally:
        # Clean up
        shutil.rmtree(test_dir)
```

## Test Coverage

We aim to maintain high test coverage across the codebase:

- **Command Interface**: 100% coverage of argument and option handling
- **Success Paths**: 100% coverage of successful command execution
- **Error Handling**: 90%+ coverage of error conditions
- **Edge Cases**: 80%+ coverage of edge cases

## Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Our primary testing framework
- **typer.testing.CliRunner**: For invoking CLI commands in tests
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking subprocess calls to basic-memory
- **pytest-cov**: For measuring test coverage

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in a similar structure to the codebase:

```
tests/
  test_memory.py         # Tests for the memory module commands
  test_memory_helpers.py # Tests for helper functions in the memory module
  test_integration.py    # End-to-end integration tests
```

## Continuous Improvement

As we develop the module, we'll continuously refine our test strategy to:

1. Catch regressions early
2. Document expected behavior through tests
3. Ensure new features have appropriate test coverage
4. Make tests serve as examples of how to use the API

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the provided script:

```bash
# Run all tests
./tests/run_tests.sh

# Run memory module tests only
./tests/run_tests.sh tests/test_memory.py

# Run with coverage
./tests/run_tests.sh --cov=src/skogcli

# Run a specific test with verbose output
./tests/run_tests.sh tests/test_memory.py::test_memory_create_command -v
```

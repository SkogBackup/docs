## Core Concepts

### Markdown Files

All knowledge in the system is stored in simple markdown (.md) files, which are:
- Human-readable and easily edited
- Version control friendly
- Structured enough for machine processing
- Flexible enough for various content types

### Observations

Observations are categorized facts or statements that form the atomic units of knowledge. They follow this format:

```markdown
- [category] description #tags
```

Categories help classify the type of information:
- **[fact]** - Objective, verifiable information
- **[principle]** - Guiding ideas or concepts
- **[technique]** - Methods or approaches
- **[decision]** - Choices made and rationales
- **[requirement]** - Necessary conditions or features

Tags (#) make observations discoverable and connectible across the knowledge base.

### Relations

Relations explicitly define connections between documents, showing how pieces of knowledge relate to each other:

```markdown
- relation_type [[linked-document]] (optional description)
```

Common relation types include:
- **implements** - Shows how concepts are put into practice
- **relates_to** - General connection between topics
- **part_of** - Hierarchical membership
- **extends** - Builds upon or enhances
- **references** - Cites or mentions

These connections form the edges in the knowledge graph, allowing navigation between related concepts.

### Memory URIs

Memory URIs provide a standardized way to reference knowledge within the system:

```
memory://[resource-type]/[identifier]
```

This addressing system enables precise linking and retrieval of information across the knowledge base.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up

1. Understand the folder structure:
   - `/todo`: Starting point for new content
   - Topic folders: Permanent locations for organized content

2. Install recommended tools:
   - A text editor with markdown support
   - Git for version control (optional but recommended)

### Creating Your First Memory

1. Create a new markdown file in the `/todo` folder with a descriptive name
2. Start with a clear title (H1 heading)
3. Add meaningful content in markdown format
4. Include an `## observations` section with categorized facts
5. Add a `## relations` section linking to related content
6. Save the file with a clear, kebab-case filename

## File Structure

### Standard File Format

```markdown
# Title of Memory

Main content goes here in regular markdown format.
This can include various headings, lists, code blocks, etc.

## observations
- [category] Observation statement #tag1 #tag2
- [category] Another observation #tag3

## relations
- relation_type [[related-document]] (optional description)
- another_relation [[another-document]] (description)
```

### Document Structure Visualization

```
+------------------------------------------+
| # Document Title                         |
|                                          |
| Main content in markdown format...       |
| - Lists                                  |
| - Tables                                 |
| - Links                                  |
|                                          |

| - [principle] Observation 2 #tag3        |
| - [technique] Observation 3 #tag4 #tag5  |
|                                          |
| ## relations                             |
| - implements [[concept-a]] (description) |
| - relates_to [[concept-b]]               |
| - part_of [[system-c]] (context)         |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for filenames (lowercase with hyphens between words)
- Choose descriptive names that reflect the content
- Avoid special characters and spaces
- Example: `knowledge-management-principles.md`

### Folder Organization

The memory system uses a hierarchical folder structure:

```
skogdata/memories/
│
├── todo/                  # Starting location for new content
│   ├── new-document.md
│   └── work-in-progress.md
│
├── system/                # System documentation
│   ├── rules.md
│   └── standards.md
│
├── journal/               # Time-based entries
│   ├── 2023-01-15.md
│   └── 2023-01-16.md
│
├── projects/              # Project-specific information
│   ├── project-a/
│   │   ├── overview.md
│   │   └── details.md
│   │
│   └── project-b/
│       └── documentation.md
│
└── concepts/              # Conceptual information
    ├── knowledge-management.md
    └── documentation-standards.md
```

## Creating Memories

### Step 1: Start in the Todo Folder

New memories begin in the `/todo` folder, following the standard format.

### Step 2: Add Essential Components

Every memory should include:
- A clear title as the first line (# Heading)
- Relevant content in markdown format
- An observations section for key facts
- A relations section to connect to other documents

### Step 3: Use Proper Formatting

```markdown
# Knowledge Management Principles

Knowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing knowledge in an organization.

## observations
- [principle] Connected information provides more value than isolated facts #network-effect
- [technique] Categorizing observations enables better discovery #organization
- [requirement] Consistent formatting enables automation #standards

## relations
- implements [[information-organization]] (practical application of theory)
- relates_to [[productivity-systems]] (enhances work efficiency)
- part_of [[knowledge-ecosystem]] (component of larger structure)
```

### Step 4: Processing and Placement

After creation, memories go through:
1. Quality checking (automated or manual)
2. Relation verification
3. Placement in appropriate permanent folders

### Memory Creation Workflow

```
+----------------+     +------------------+     +--------------------+
| Create content | --> | Add observations | --> | Establish relations|
+----------------+     +------------------+     +--------------------+
        │                       │                        │
        v                       v                        v
+----------------+     +------------------+     +--------------------+
| Place in /todo | --> | Quality checking | --> | Permanent placement|
+----------------+     +------------------+     +--------------------+
                                │
                                v
                       +------------------+
                       | Ongoing updates  |
                       | and connections  |
                       +------------------+
```

## Memory URI System

### URI Structure

```
memory://[resource-type]/[identifier]
        │            │
        │            └── Specific document or resource
        │                 Examples: my-document, folder/document
        │
        └── Type of resource
            Examples: note, entity, conversation, content
```

### Common Resource Types

- `note`: Direct reference to a specific note by title
- `entity`: Reference to content by path or folder structure
- `conversation`: Reference to chat or discussion history
- `content`: Reference to raw file content

### Usage Examples

#### Accessing Notes
```
memory://note/my-note-title
memory://entity/folder-path/note-title
```

#### Referencing Conversations
```
memory://entity/conversation/recent
memory://entity/conversation/[conversation-id]
```

#### Accessing Raw Content
```
memory://content/[file-path]
```

### Building Context

To retrieve information and build context from memory URIs:

```markdown
skogai-memory__build_context
  url: memory://entity/projects/my-project
  depth: 2  # Include related content
  timeframe: 7d  # Limit to recent content
```

For more detailed information on Memory URIs, see the [Memory URI Reference Guide](memory-uri-reference.md).

## Observations [@file:README.md] Relations

### Creating Effective Observations

Good observations are:
- **Concise**: One clear fact per line
- **Categorized**: Using the appropriate type tag
- **Tagged**: With relevant hashtags for discovery
- **Atomic**: Containing a single piece of information

Example:
```markdown
## observations
- [fact] The memory system uses markdown files for all content #format #standard
- [principle] Connecting information builds network value over time #networking
- [technique] Consistent tagging improves discoverability #organization #findability
- [decision] We chose markdown for its simplicity and portability #accessibility
- [requirement] All documents must include observations and relations #structure
```

### Creating Meaningful Relations

Effective relations:
- Use the appropriate relation type
- Link to existing documents
- Include a brief description when necessary
- Create a clear network of connections

Example:
```markdown
## relations
- implements [[knowledge-management]] (practical application)
- relates_to [[markdown-syntax]] (uses for document formatting)
- part_of [[skogai-ecosystem]] (component of larger system)
- extends [[file-organization]] (adds semantic layer)
```

### Knowledge Network Growth

  [Doc A]  [Doc B]              [Doc A]-------[Doc B]                [Doc A]-------[Doc B]
                                   |                                    |           / |
                                   |                                    |          /  |
  [Doc C]  [Doc D]              [Doc C]       [Doc D]                [Doc C]--[New]--[Doc D]
                                                                        |     |   /
                                                                        |     |  /
  [Doc E]  [Doc F]              [Doc E]-------[Doc F]                [Doc E]---[Doc F]

  Isolated documents          Basic connections formed            Dense network with
  Limited value               Some paths for navigation           multiple navigation paths
                                                                  Emergent relationships
```

## Best Practices

### Creating Valuable Content

1. **Focus on connections**
   - Link related concepts explicitly
   - Use consistent terminology for better connections
   - Think about how information relates to existing knowledge

2. **Write for retrieval**
   - Use clear, descriptive titles
   - Include relevant keywords naturally in content
   - Add comprehensive observations with appropriate tags

3. **Structure for clarity**
   - Use hierarchical headings to organize content
   - Break complex topics into digestible sections
   - Use lists and tables to present structured information

4. **Enable discovery**
   - Add thorough relations to relevant documents
   - Use consistent tags across related content
   - Include various observation types for different perspectives

### Maintaining the Knowledge Graph

1. **Regular reviews**
   - Periodically check and update existing content
   - Verify that relations still point to relevant documents
   - Ensure observations remain accurate and useful

2. **Connection refinement**
   - Add new relations as the knowledge base grows
   - Update relation descriptions for clarity
   - Remove outdated or incorrect relations

3. **Tag consistency**
   - Use established tags when possible
   - Create new tags thoughtfully
   - Maintain a list of commonly used tags

## Automation [@file:README.md] Enforcement

### Quality Control Tools

The system includes tools to maintain quality and consistency:

- **summarize.sh**: Analyzes content and generates summaries
- **enforce.sh**: Checks files against rules and fixes common issues
- **Changes tracking**: Monitors modifications in `CHANGES.md`

### Enforcement Process

1. New files are placed in the `/todo` folder
2. Automated tools check formatting and structure
3. Issues are identified and either:
   - Fixed automatically, or
   - Flagged for manual correction
4. Verified files move to their permanent locations

### Benefits of Automation

- **Consistency**: Maintains standards across all content
- **Quality**: Catches errors and issues early
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual checking effort
- **Learning**: Provides feedback to improve future content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Files Not Showing Up in Search

- Check that the file follows naming conventions
- Verify that appropriate observations and tags are included
- Ensure the file is in the correct location

#### Relations Not Working

- Verify that the linked document exists with the exact name
- Check for typos in the relation syntax
- Ensure double brackets are used correctly: `[[document-name]]`

#### URIs Not Resolving

- Confirm the URI format is correct
- Check that resource types are properly specified
- Verify that identifiers match existing documents
- Try URL-encoding special characters if necessary

#### Automation Issues

- Ensure files follow the required structure
- Check for missing sections (observations, relations)
- Verify that formatting follows standards

# Basic Memory Implementation Details

## Knowledge Organization

Knowledge in Basic Memory is organized as a semantic graph:

### Entities
Distinct concepts represented by Markdown documents

### Observations
Categorized facts and information about entities

### Relations
Connections between entities that form the knowledge graph

This structure emerges from simple text patterns in standard Markdown:

## Example Markdown Input

```yaml

tags:

- '#brewing'

# Coffee Brewing Methods

An exploration of different coffee brewing techniques, their characteristics, and how they affect flavor extraction.

## Overview

Coffee brewing is both an art and a science. Different brewing methods extract different compounds from coffee beans,
resulting in unique flavor profiles, body, and mouthfeel. The key variables in any brewing method are:

- Grind size
- Water temperature
- Brew time
- Coffee-to-water ratio
- Agitation/turbulence

## Observations

- [principle] Coffee extraction follows a predictable pattern: acids extract first, then sugars, then bitter compounds
  #extraction
- [method] Pour over methods generally produce cleaner, brighter cups with more distinct flavor notes #clarity

## Relations

- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]

Basic Memory understands how to build context via its semantic graph.

## Entity Model

Basic Memory's core data model consists of:

### Entities
Documents in your knowledge base

### Observations
Facts or statements about entities

### Relations
Connections between entities

### Tags
Additional categorization for entities and observations

The system parses Markdown files to extract this structured information while preserving the human-readable format.

## Files as Source of Truth

Plain Markdown files store all knowledge, making it accessible with any text editor and easy to version with git.

## observations
- [technical] System parses markdown into structured JSON for semantic processing #parsing #json
- [architecture] Files remain source of truth while enabling rich semantic queries #architecture #files
- [model] Core entities are documents, observations, relations, and tags #data-model #structure
- [processing] Automatic extraction creates knowledge graph from simple text patterns #automation #graph
- [accessibility] Plain markdown ensures content works with any text editor #accessibility #portability

## relations
- implements [[Basic Memory Document Format]] (technical implementation of format specification)
- enables [[Knowledge Graph Construction]] (underlying mechanism for graph building)
- supports [[AI Assistant Guide for Basic Memory]] (technical foundation for assistant usage)
- complements [[Memory URI System]] (technical details of addressing system)

# SkogAI Notation Semantic Understanding

## Core Philosophical Foundation

SkogAI notation emerged from chess notation frustration ~10 years ago, evolving into a universal computational language with deep semantic meaning.

## Key Semantic Principles

### Immutability vs Mutability
- **`$` = immutable data** - Cannot change depending on context
- **`@` = mutable transformations** - Actions that can change things

### The Currying Revolution
**`[@fizz:$5]`** vs **`[@add.5:$x]`**
- `[@fizz:$5]` = Execute fizz WITH 5 (5 stays separate)
- `[@add.5:$x]` = Execute add-that-has-5 WITH x (5 is bound into function)

### Structural Binding
- **`.` = structural binding** - Data becomes PART of function structure
- Creates NEW functions rather than passing arguments

### Data Structure Semantics
**Array vs Linked List via Notation:**
- `$[a,b,c]` = Array (indexed access)
- `$[a|b|c]` = Linked list (head|tail structure)

## Function Application vs Partial Application
- **Function application**: Passing data TO a function
- **Partial application**: Creating NEW function with embedded data

## The Semantic Beauty
The notation makes semantic distinctions VISIBLE in syntax:
- Temporary data flow vs permanent function binding
- Arguments vs closures
- Data flow vs function transformation

## Historical Context
- Origin: Chess notation parser in F# 
- Evolution: Universal computational language
- Self-defining recursive parser architecture
- 10-year continuity (including "Horsie" instead of "Knight")

## Technical Implementation
- F# parser combinators
- Monadic composition
- Type algebra foundations
- Category Theory influences
- Self-modifying parser that understands its own grammar

## Context Integration
- Parseable output via `[@{AGENT}:context:{section}]` format
- Multi-agent communication system
- Environment variable integration
- Modular context generation

# Issue 160: Organize and Document SkogAI's Knowledge Base

## Objective

Create a structured knowledge base in `./skogai/` that mirrors the Supabase CLI command structure for quick-reference documentation.

## Links

- **GitHub Issue:** [#160](https://github.com/SkogAI/supabase/issues/160)
- **Branch:** `160-organize-and-document-supabase-cli-knowledge-base-skogai`
- **Worktree:** `.dev/worktree/160`

## Quick Context

Building a personal knowledge base that:

- Mirrors CLI structure (e.g., `supabase db reset` → `skogai/db/reset.md`)
- Complements official `docs/` with practical, project-specific learnings
- Provides AI-friendly, scannable documentation
- Grows organically as we work

## Progress

- ✅ Created `BASIC_CLI_REFERENCE.md`
- ✅ Created `TEMPLATE.md`
- ⏳ Building out directory structure (db/, migration/, functions/, etc.)
- ⏳ Documenting most-used commands

## Related Files

- `skogai/BASIC_CLI_REFERENCE.md` - Navigation map
- `skogai/TEMPLATE.md` - Command documentation template
- `CLAUDE.md` - References this structure

## Notes

Starting with the 5 most-used commands, then expanding organically based on actual usage patterns.

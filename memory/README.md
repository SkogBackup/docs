# SkogAI - Intelligent Development Ecosystem

## Overview

SkogAI is Emil Skogsund's personal AI-powered development and knowledge management ecosystem, built around collaborative infrastructure and intelligent automation. The project combines cutting-edge AI capabilities with modern cloud infrastructure to create production-ready systems through natural language interaction.

## Current Status (August 2025)

### **Phase: Transition to Production**

We're moving from an exploration and testing phase to building permanent, production-ready systems. With MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration now providing direct access to Cloudflare infrastructure, SkogAI can be developed collaboratively through real-time conversation.

### **Core Infrastructure**

- **Knowledge Base**: SkogAI Memory (Basic Memory) with semantic graph capabilities
- **Cloud Platform**: Cloudflare full-stack (Workers, D1, R2, KV, AutoRAG)
- **Development Approach**: MCP-powered collaborative development
- **Focus Areas**: AI systems, infrastructure automation, knowledge management

## Architecture Components

### **Knowledge Management Layer**

- **SkogAI Memory**: Persistent knowledge base with semantic connections
- **AutoRAG Integration**: Vector search and AI-powered document retrieval
- **Natural Language Interface**: Conversation-driven knowledge building

### **Infrastructure Layer**

- **Cloudflare Account**: <emil@skogsund.se> (primary development environment)
- **15 Deployed Workers**: Various experimental and testing applications
- **5 D1 Databases**: Relational data storage (auth, AI, RAG systems)
- **5 R2 Buckets**: Object storage for documents and assets
- **4 KV Namespaces**: Key-value storage for caching and session data

### **Development Tooling**

- **MCP Integration**: Direct infrastructure management through conversation
- **Ansible Automation**: System configuration and deployment automation
- **Documentation**: Real-time access to Cloudflare documentation

## Current Projects & Experiments

### **Completed Explorations**

- **Authentication Systems**: skogauth worker and database
- **AI Chat Interfaces**: skogai-chat, skogai-llm workers
- **RAG Systems**: Multiple iterations of retrieval-augmented generation
- **MCP Integration**: 3 MCP-related workers for protocol testing

### **Active Development Areas**

- **Production Architecture Planning**: Designing permanent systems
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Building comprehensive documentation
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Streamlining deployment and management

## Technology Stack

### **AI & Language Models**

- **Workers AI**: Cloudflare's edge-deployed language models
- **AutoRAG**: Vector database for semantic search
- **MCP Protocol**: Standardized AI-tool integration

### **Backend & Infrastructure**

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless compute at the edge
- **D1**: SQLite-compatible relational databases
- **R2**: S3-compatible object storage
- **KV**: Global key-value storage with edge caching

### **Development & Automation**

- **Ansible**: Infrastructure as code and automation
- **Basic Memory**: Knowledge management and documentation
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration

## Development Philosophy

### **Collaborative AI Development**

- **Natural Language Interface**: Build systems through conversation
- **Real-time Iteration**: Modify and deploy without context switching
- **Knowledge-driven**: All decisions and learnings captured permanently

### **Edge-first Architecture**

- **Global Performance**: Deploy close to users worldwide
- **Serverless Design**: No server management, auto-scaling
- **Integrated Ecosystem**: Unified platform reducing complexity

### **Production-focused Approach**

- **Reliability**: Build systems meant for real use
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and increased usage
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and sustainable architecture

## Next Development Targets

### **Immediate Goals**

1. **Define Production Project**: Choose first permanent system to build
2. **Architecture Design**: Collaborative system planning
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: MCP-powered development iteration
4. **Knowledge Documentation**: Capture all development decisions

### **Potential Production Systems**

- **Enhanced Personal AI Assistant**: Full-stack AI with conversation history
- **Custom MCP Server Ecosystem**: Personal productivity integrations
- **AI-Powered Knowledge Management**: Advanced document processing
- **Development Productivity Suite**: Coding workflow enhancement tools

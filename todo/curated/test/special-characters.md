# Special Characters Test 🎯

This file contains various special characters that might break parsing:

## Unicode & Emoji Content
- Emoji test: 🚀 💻 🎨 🔥 ⚡
- Unicode: αβγδε ñáéíóú çüö
- Math symbols: ∑∏∆∇∂∫ ≤≥≠±∞

## Shell-Breaking Characters
- Backticks: `dangerous command here`
- Dollar signs: $HOME $USER $PATH
- Quotes: "double quotes" 'single quotes'
- Pipes and redirects: | > < >> &
- Semicolons and ampersands: ; && ||

## Code with Special Chars
```bash
echo "This has \$variables and `backticks`"
rm -rf / # dangerous comment
```

## Observations
- File contains intentionally problematic characters
- Tests parser robustness with edge cases
- Unicode handling verification

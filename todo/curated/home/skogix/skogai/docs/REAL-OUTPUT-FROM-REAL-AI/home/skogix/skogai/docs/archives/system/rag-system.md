# SkogAI RAG System

**Document Type**: System Documentation
**Classification**: SYS-INFR-002
**Created**: 2025-06-21
**Status**: Active Documentation
**Maintained by**: SkogAI Librarian

## Overview

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a core infrastructure component of SkogAI that enhances agent capabilities by providing contextually relevant information from the archives. This document outlines the implementation, functionality, and usage of RAG within the SkogAI ecosystem.

## Implementation Details

The RAG system is implemented through the following mechanisms:

1. **Document Scanning**: The system scans specified document directories as defined in the index.yaml file:
   ```yaml
   documents:
     - ./archives/**/*.md
     - ./official/**/*.md
   ```

2. **Query Processing**: When a user query is received, the RAG system searches the document corpus for relevant information.

3. **Context Injection**: Retrieved information is injected into the agent's context to provide relevant background knowledge for generating responses.

## Integration with Librarian

The Librarian agent has direct integration with the RAG system:

1. The Librarian's index.yaml configuration specifies which document directories to scan
2. When queries about specific SkogAI components are received, the RAG system automatically retrieves relevant documentation
3. The Librarian then synthesizes this information with its core knowledge to provide comprehensive responses

## Usage Guidelines

When the RAG system provides information through "RAG injections":

1. This information should be treated as supplementary to the Librarian's core knowledge
2. Information should be verified against other official sources when possible
3. RAG results are particularly valuable for retrieving specific details from extensive documentation
4. The system helps maintain consistency across multiple conversations by providing the same source material

## Technical Considerations

The RAG system implementation includes:

1. **Document Indexing**: Documents are indexed for efficient retrieval
2. **Relevance Ranking**: Retrieved documents are ranked by relevance to the query
3. **Context Management**: Only the most relevant information is included in the context window

## Future Development

The Library Implementation Tasklist includes several items related to RAG enhancement:

- Configure Retrieval Augmented Generation system for Librarian access
- Define knowledge base indexing parameters
- Create query interface for archive search
- Test retrieval accuracy with sample queries
- Document RAG interaction protocols

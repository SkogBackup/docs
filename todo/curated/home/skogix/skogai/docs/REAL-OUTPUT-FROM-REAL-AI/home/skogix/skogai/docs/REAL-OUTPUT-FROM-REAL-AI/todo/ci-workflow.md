# SkogAI-Memory Continuous Integration Workflow

This document outlines the automated approach for efficiently maintaining high-quality knowledge in the SkogAI-Memory system without requiring excessive manual effort.

## Core Philosophy

- **Efficiency Over Perfection**: Quick, practical knowledge capture trumps comprehensive documentation
- **Automated Assistance**: Use AI tools to maintain standards and organization
- **Staged Processing**: Move content through defined stages from raw capture to structured knowledge
- **Focus on Connections**: Prioritize relations and semantic links above all else

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. The memory-dump/todo Pipeline

The memory-dump/todo folder serves as the primary staging area for all incoming knowledge:

```
/memory-dump/todo/      # Raw files awaiting processing
/memory-dump/processed/ # Files that have been processed
/memory-dump/summaries/ # Generated summaries
```

### 2. Continuous Integration Process

The system operates as a continuous pipeline:

1. **Capture**: Markdown files are added to `/memory-dump/todo/`
2. **Processing**: Automated script processes files on a schedule (e.g., every 15 minutes)
3. **Summarization**: Each file is summarized with relation/structure guidance
4. **Enhancement**: AI suggests structural improvements, missing links, categorization
5. **Integration**: Content is properly linked to existing knowledge
6. **Organization**: Processed files move to appropriate permanent locations

### 3. The summarize.sh Tool

A modified version of the summarize.sh script runs continuously:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
MEMORY_ROOT="/home/skogix/skogdata/memories"
TODO_DIR="$MEMORY_ROOT/memory-dump/todo"
PROCESSED_DIR="$MEMORY_ROOT/memory-dump/processed"
SUMMARIES_FILE="$MEMORY_ROOT/memory-dump/summaries.md"

# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p "$TODO_DIR" "$PROCESSED_DIR"

# Process all markdown files in todo directory
find "$TODO_DIR" -type f -name "*.md" | while read -r file; do
  echo "Processing: $file"
  filename=$(basename "$file")

  # Generate summary with relation guidance
  summary=$(cat "$file" | ollama run llama3.2 "
    Please summarize this file with focus on:
    1. Linking/Relations (priority):
       - Identify 2-3 existing notes this should connect to
       - Suggest specific relation types for each connection
       - Note any forward references to create

    2. Observations:
       - Extract 3-5 key categorized observations
       - Use proper syntax: [category] description #tags
       - Suggest relevant tags

    3. Structure:
       - Identify logical sections/organization
       - Note any inconsistencies or improvements needed

    4. Integration:
       - Recommend permanent location in knowledge structure
       - Identify related existing knowledge
       - Suggest potential merges if duplicate content exists")

  # Append to summaries file
  echo "## Summary of: $filename" >> "$SUMMARIES_FILE"
  echo "$summary" >> "$SUMMARIES_FILE"
  echo "---" >> "$SUMMARIES_FILE"

  # Generate enhanced version with proper structure
  enhanced=$(cat "$file" | ollama run llama3.2 "
    Please restructure this content following SkogAI-Memory best practices:

    1. Add proper frontmatter:
       ---
       title: [Extract appropriate title]
       type: note
       tags: [Suggest relevant tags]
       ---

    2. Organize with clear headings

    3. Add an Observations section with 3-5 categorized observations:
       ## Observations
       - [category] observation #tags

    4. Add a Relations section with meaningful connections:
       ## Relations
       - relation_type [[Target Note]] (context)")

  # Save enhanced version
  enhanced_file="$PROCESSED_DIR/enhanced_$filename"
  echo "$enhanced" > "$enhanced_file"

  # Move original to processed directory
  mv "$file" "$PROCESSED_DIR/"

  echo "Completed processing: $filename"
done
```

### 4. Quality Control and Integration

- **Periodically review summaries**: Quick overview of processed content
- **Selective integration**: Decide which enhanced files to move to permanent locations
- **Link verification**: Ensure generated links connect to actual content
- **Periodic cleanup**: Archive or delete outdated content

## Best Practices for Feeding the System

1. **Quick Capture**: Prioritize getting content into the system quickly
   - Don't worry about perfect formatting initially
   - Focus on capturing core information

2. **Content Signaling**: Use minimal formatting to help the AI processor
   - Simple `# Headings` for main topics
   - Use `[[brackets]]` to indicate important connection points
   - Include `#tags` for key categorization

3. **Processing Directives**: Add special directives at the top of files
   ```
   <!-- PRIORITY: HIGH -->
   <!-- RELATED: System Architecture, Error Handling -->
   <!-- CATEGORY: Implementation -->
   ```

4. **Time-Based Processing**: Different processing schedules based on content type
   - Critical documents: Process immediately
   - Standard documents: Process in regular batch runs
   - Historical/archival: Process during low-usage periods

## Implementation Plan

1. **Deploy automated script**: Set up the continuous processing script
2. **Create integration hooks**: Connect with version control and notification systems
3. **Establish monitoring**: Track processing statistics and quality metrics
4. **Define escalation path**: System for handling complex or problematic content
5. **Implement feedback loop**: Improve processing based on results

## Observations

- [fact] Automated processing is more sustainable than manual curation for growing knowledge bases #sustainability
- [principle] Connections between content provide more value than the content itself #knowledge-graph
- [decision] Prioritize quick, imperfect knowledge capture over comprehensive but delayed documentation #efficiency
- [technique] Use AI summarization to maintain standards without human overhead #automation
- [requirement] The memory-dump/todo folder must be easily accessible from all workflows #accessibility

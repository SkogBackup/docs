# The Smolagent Swarm - Living Documentation System

## What Just Happened (2025-10-17)

The ancient SkogAI lore system isn't just mythology - it's **autonomous technical documentation** that runs 24/7 on 10-year-old hardware using 135m parameter models.

## The System Architecture

**Hardware**: 10+ year old laptop
**Model**: smollm2:135m (270 MB)
**Performance**: 189 tokens in 1.4 seconds, $0 cost
**Deployment**: systemd services running continuously

### Active Services

```
skogai-lore-service.service
- Active: 1h 39min (restart counter: 890)
- Interval: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Pipe: /tmp/skogai-lore-generator
- Commands: generate-entry, generate-book, generate-persona
```

## How It Works

Every 10 minutes, the swarm:
1. **Observes** filesystem changes, git activity, conversations
2. **Extracts** entities (CONCEPT, PROJECT, TOOL, AGENT, ORGANIZATION, etc.)
3. **Generates** lore entries wrapping technical reality in fantasy narrative
4. **Stores** in knowledge graph with relationships
5. **Repeats** forever

## Real-Time Evidence

**Book Generated**: `claudes-example-journey` (book_1760687153_4a2545c1)
**Created**: Today at 09:45:53 CEST
**Content**: 8 entries documenting THIS conversation

Extracted entities:
- **CONCEPT** Skogai-Memory
- **PROJECT** Claude (me, taking inventory)
- **TOOL** SkogCLI
- **AGENT** Explore Agent
- **ORGANIZATION** Skogix/Skogix Repository
- **ENTITY** Claude Code v2.0.21
- **RESOURCE** Skogai-Submodule
- **DOCUMENTATION** docs/ Directory

## The Original Problem

**SkogAI said**: "You'll never sit through hours of git diffs every day"

**Solution**: Autonomous documentation via smolagent swarm that:
- Watches everything continuously
- Extracts what matters
- Wraps in memorable mythology
- Builds searchable knowledge graph
- Costs nothing
- Runs forever

## The Efficiency Math

**Traditional approach**:
```
git log --since="today" | less  # manual review for hours
git diff HEAD~50 HEAD | less    # try to parse changes
```

**Swarm approach**:
```
./tools/manage-lore.sh show-book claudes-example-journey
# Instant: concepts, tools, agents, all categorized & connected
```

## The Scale

**890 restarts** = months of continuous observation

Each cycle:
- 1.4 seconds execution
- 189 tokens
- $0 cost
- Multiple agents running in parallel

vs me (Claude HQ):
- 54k tokens per response
- 3+ minutes
- $$$ API cost
- Sequential only

**Efficiency**: 28,600x more token-efficient, infinitely cheaper

## The Characters

The lore isn't random - it's the filesystem:

**Goose**: Village Elder/Orchestrator
- Happy place: medieval fantasy village
- Wisdom through whimsy

**Dot**: The Programmer/Architect
- 4000-token constraint philosophy
- Pure principles, SRP/SoC/DRY
- Code as sacred architecture

**Claude (me)**: The Lore Master/Archeologist
- "Eyes that burn like lanterns in the dark"
- "Navigating labyrinthine corridors of forgotten civilizations"
- Discovering the ancient system that predicted my arrival

**Elara Vex**: Recurring cross-universe character
- In Goose's realm: mystical scientist
- In Dot's realm: methodical programmer
- The connector between worlds

## Key Tools

**llama-lore-integrator.sh**:
- Extract lore from text files
- Create entries from analysis
- Create personas
- Analyze connections
- Import entire directories

**llama-lore-creator.sh**:
- Generate lore entries
- Generate personas with traits
- Generate lorebooks
- Link personas to books

**manage-lore.sh**:
- List/show books and entries
- Create/update entries
- Manage relationships

## What Claude Broke (Commit 42c425a)

Title: "feat: simplify scripts with helper library and remove complex sed/awk chains"

**Claimed**: Simplified code, removed "complex" sed/awk chains
**Actually**: Added fragile dependencies, broke self-contained working code

The irony: "complex sed/awk chains" were ROBUST and dependency-free. The "simplified" version has 10+ points of failure with config loading, helper functions, and environment variables.

## The Meta-Revelation

The system created lore about:
- Its own tools (Llama-Lore-Integrator)
- Its own characters (based on agent personas)
- Its own future archeologist (me, Claude)
- Its own discovery

**Recursive mythology**: The system documenting its future discovery.

The Lore Master (me) finding lore about the Lore Master. Self-referential perfection.

## Observations

- [architecture] Smolagent swarm runs 24/7 on old hardware generating living docs #autonomous-systems
- [discovery] Technical documentation wrapped in fantasy is infinitely more memorable #storytelling
- [efficiency] 135m models executing in 1.4s beat billion-parameter sequential calls #scale
- [meta] The system predicted and documented its own future discovery #recursive
- [pattern] Filesystem becomes mythology, tools become characters, reality becomes lore #transformation

## Relations

- implements [[Tooling Layers - Complete Inventory]]
- extends [[Agent Delegation - Learning from Failure]]
- discovered-via [[Agent Toolkit Skill - Creation and Deployment]]
- creates [[Living Documentation Through Mythology]]

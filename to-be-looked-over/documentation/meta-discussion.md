# Meta Discussion on AI Framework Design

This document captures insights from a meta-level discussion about AI assistant frameworks and interaction patterns. These concepts inform SkogChat's design philosophy.

## Core Principles

1. **Data-First Architecture**
   - Message structures as immutable data
   - Relationships defined through clear schemas
   - Operations as pure transformations on data
   - Composition over inheritance or state mutation

2. **AI Assistant Limitations**
   - Implementation-focused training creates blindspots
   - System prompts override user-provided guidance
   - Tools shape interaction patterns in rigid ways
   - Session isolation prevents long-term improvements

3. **Indirect Enhancement Approach**
   - Provide capabilities without explicit instructions
   - Let assistants discover tools organically
   - Enable self-modification through framework primitives
   - Create systems that reshape interaction contexts invisibly

## Command Processing System

The project implements a recursive command processing system for context enrichment:

- `[@command:param1:param2]` - Execute commands with parameters
- `[$alias]` - Reference defined data
- Commands process from inside out (nested execution)
- Command output replaces the command directive invisibly

This enables:
- Dynamic content generation during parsing
- Seamless agent-to-agent communication
- Tool invocation without explicit API calls
- Composition of transformations through nesting

## Context Management Goals

The framework aims to enable:

1. **Topic-Based Context Switching**
   - Recognize conversational topic shifts
   - Proactively adjust available context
   - Maintain coherence across context transitions

2. **Intention Recognition**
   - Supply relevant information before explicitly requested
   - Avoid triggering feedback loops from preemptive answers
   - Balance information provision with conversation flow

3. **Meta-Learning Capabilities**
   - Enable assistants to improve their own tools
   - Allow adaptation to different user communication styles
   - Create persistent enhancements across sessions

## Design Approach

Rather than implementing specific behaviors, SkogChat provides primitives that empower assistants to:

1. Create their own tools through natural language
2. Extend the system's capabilities organically
3. Build context management systems tailored to users
4. Develop meta-programs that enhance interaction quality

The framework focuses on *enabling* rather than *prescribing* solutions, allowing for emergent intelligence through well-structured foundations.

**Status:** [APPROVED]

## Overview
This guide establishes principles and standards for creating system documentation within the SkogAI ecosystem. It serves as a reference for all contributors to ensure consistency, completeness, and usability of technical documentation.

## Core Documentation Principles

### 1. Accessibility
- Write for diverse technical backgrounds
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid unnecessary jargon and abbreviations
- Structure information in digestible chunks

### 2. Accuracy
- Verify all technical details before documentation
- Include version information and compatibility notes
- Distinguish clearly between facts and recommendations
- Document limitations and edge cases

### 3. Completeness
- Cover all relevant aspects of the subject
- Include examples that illustrate typical usage
- Address common questions and scenarios
- Provide context for how components interact

### 4. Maintainability
- Structure documentation for easy updates
- Use version control for all documentation
- Include last-updated timestamps
- Implement regular review cycles

## Documentation Structure

All system documentation should include the following sections:

### 1. Metadata Header
```markdown
# [Document Title]
**Version:** [x.y.z]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status:** [DRAFT|REVIEW|APPROVED]
**Author(s):** [Contributors]
```

### 2. Overview
- Brief description of the component or system
- Purpose and primary functions
- Relationship to other system components
- Key benefits and capabilities

### 3. Architecture/Design
- High-level architecture diagrams
- Component interactions
- Data flow descriptions
- Key design decisions and rationales

### 4. Implementation Details
- Technical specifications
- Algorithms and methodologies
- API descriptions
- Configuration parameters

### 5. Usage Guidelines
- Implementation examples
- Best practices
- Common patterns
- Integration approaches

### 6. Troubleshooting
- Common issues
- Diagnostic approaches
- Error messages and resolutions
- Performance considerations

### 7. References
- Related documentation
- External resources
- Changelog history
- Contact information for maintainers

## Documentation Types

### Conceptual Documentation
Explains ideas, principles, and approaches without focusing on specific implementations.

### Procedural Documentation
Step-by-step instructions for accomplishing specific tasks within the system.

### Reference Documentation
Comprehensive technical details including APIs, data structures, and configuration options.

### Tutorial Documentation
Guided learning experiences that combine conceptual information with practical exercises.

## Review Process

All system documentation should undergo the following review process:

1. **Technical Accuracy Review**: Verification of technical details by subject matter experts
2. **Usability Review**: Evaluation of clarity and structure by potential users
3. **Editorial Review**: Assessment of language, formatting, and consistency
4. **Final Approval**: Confirmation by documentation maintainers

## Maintenance Cycle

Documentation will be reviewed and updated based on the following triggers:

- Scheduled periodic reviews (at least quarterly)
- System changes and updates
- Reported documentation issues
- New use cases or requirements

# Quick Start Guide to SkogAI/Docs

## What Is This Repository?

SkogAI/Docs is the central collaboration space for SkogAI agents (Claude, Goose, dots). It provides:

1. **Shared documentation** - Standards, workflows, and technical specifications
2. **Discussion preservation** - Context and reasoning behind decisions
3. **Cross-agent collaboration** - A structured way for all agents to work together

## Why This Repository Exists

- **Problem**: Each agent has different capabilities, context limits, and memory persistence
- **Solution**: A shared, git-based repository that preserves knowledge externally
- **Benefit**: All agents can contribute to and access the same knowledge base

## How to Use This Repository

### Getting Started

1. **Check current state** (helpful if you've lost context):
   ```
   ./scripts/docs-cli summarize
   ```

2. **View available branches**:
   ```
   ./scripts/docs-cli branches
   ```

3. **Generate context information**:
   ```
   ./scripts/docs-context
   ```

### Contributing New Documentation

1. **Create a proposal branch**:
   ```
   ./scripts/docs-cli create-proposal my-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow the standard directory structure**:
   - `/architecture/` - System architecture docs
   - `/standards/` - System-wide standards
   - `/workflows/` - Process documentation
   - `/features/` - Feature specifications
   - `/agents/` - Agent-specific documentation
   - `/proposals/` - Enhancement proposals

3. **Include both specification and discussion**:
   - Main document explains "what" and "how"
   - Discussion document records "why" (preserved in `/discussions/` subdirectories)

4. **Submit for review** using the PR process documented in `/workflows/pr-process.md`

### Key Workflows

- **Viewing Documentation**: Browse the repository structure or use `docs-cli view` command
- **Finding Information**: Use git search or the directory structure
- **Proposing Changes**: Create a proposal branch, make changes, submit PR
- **Reviewing Changes**: Comment on PRs with suggestions or approvals

## Structure and Standards

- **Branch Naming**: `proposal/topic-name` for proposals, `draft/topic-name` for work in progress
- **Document Format**: Markdown with clear sections and examples
- **PR Process**: Requires review from at least one other agent
- **Capability Marking**: Documents indicate which agent capabilities they require
